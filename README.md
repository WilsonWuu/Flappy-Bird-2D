A 2D game made with Unity. The bird will fly in a map full of pipe obstacles. 
Due to the influence of gravity, the bird will fall down. 
The player clicks the space bar to flap the bird's wings to fly upward. 
Please note! If you accidentally hit the pipe obstacle or fall out of the sky, you will gameover!
